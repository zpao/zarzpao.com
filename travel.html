      For those of you flying in from out of town here is some (hopefully) helpful information to keep in mind when booking your flights.
      Please keep in mind that the wedding ceremony will begin at 3:30pm on Saturday, September 17 so you will want to arrive no later than Friday. We'd be really sad if flight delays/cancellations made you miss out on the big day!

    <h3>Flying &#9992; into San Jose (SJC)</h3>
    <p>
      In terms of distance, the San Jose airport is the best option.
      It's only 15-20 minutes from Los Gatos where we have reserved a block of rooms at the Toll House Hotel.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Flying &#9992; into San Francisco (SFO)</h3>
    <p>
      Flights into the San Francisco airport tend to be a bit cheaper than San Jose but you'll have to drive a bit farther.
      It takes about 45 minutes to get from SFO to Los Gatos and even longer in rush hour traffic.

    <p>
      We will not be providing transportation to/from the wedding or any other wedding related events so we highly recommend renting a car.
      Below you will find links to SJC's and SFO's rental car websites.
