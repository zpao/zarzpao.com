      We haven't registered for anything yet, but we like the initiative! :)

      We live in a small apartment and have a lot of what we need already (and honestly can't fit much more!)
      For those of you who insist on getting us a gift we'll be creating a honeymoon registry, allowing people to contribute to our honeymoon adventure!
      We're not 100% sure where we're going yet, but you'll be able to pick a specific activity or item to contribute to.
      We'd much rather have amazing memories than material things!
