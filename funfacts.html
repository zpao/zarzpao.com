      Rather than bore you with a long story about how we met &amp; fell in love, here are a handful of facts about Amanda, Paul, or both of us!
    </p>

    <h3>We Love&hellip;</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Pittsburgh Steelers, duh.</li>
      <li>Traveling &mdash; We enjoy visiting foreign countries and taking road trips along the California coast.</li>
      <li>Pets &mdash; Tanzee is our little cat friend, but we hope to get a puppy friend soon!</li>
      <li>The letter "Z".</li>
      <li>Sleeping in on the weekends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We Hate&hellip;</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Baltimore Ravens, duh.</li>
      <li>And now more recently, the Green Bay Packers.</li>
      <li>Cleaning up cat puke.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We Don't Quite Agree On&hellip;</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Who should do the dishes. Paul did them last so it's Amanda's turn.</li>
      <li>Where the middle of the bed is.</li>
      <li>How to define "clean".</li>
      <li>Whether or not Taylor Swift should be turned all the way up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ZARZPAO?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Paul's nickname is "zpao" - he invented that one in high school based on his love of the letter "Z" and his initials.</li>
      <li>Amanda's nickname is "zar" - Paul gave that to her after he realized she was awesome and deserving of sharing the awesomeness of the "Z".</li>
      <li>Their powers combined, they form ZARZPAO!</li>
