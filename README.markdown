# It's a wedding website

Some basic stuffs:

* I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to make static HTML cooler.
* It's a work in progress.
* You're creepy if you fork this (seriously).
* No crashing the wedding.

## Licensesssss

* Fuck it, it's free to use. But stay classy and don't claim it as your own if you steal the style.
* If you steal the content... WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
