    <h2>The Big Day</h2>
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>
      Both the ceremony and the reception will take place at Radonich Ranch, a historic fruit packing ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains right off of Highway 17.
      Please keep in mind that you will be driving down windy mountain roads so you'll want to make sure that you have a designated driver lined up.
      Driving drunk is never a good idea, but trust us when we say it is an ESPECIALLY bad idea on these roads!

    </ul>

    <h3>Schedule of Events</h3>
    <p>
      The ceremony will begin at 3:30pm but you can start arriving as early as 3pm.
      Cocktail hour, dinner, dancing and general awesomeness will follow.
    </p>

    <h3>Dress Code</h3>
    <p>
      No tuxes necessary but no jeans either!
      Semi-casual but comfortable is what we're going for.
      The ceremony and reception will be held outdoors so ladies, we recommend flats.
      As for weather, it will most likely be warm during the day (80's) and cool at night (50's).
      We recommend having a jacket or sweater handy for when the sun sets because it can get chilly!
    </p>


    <h2>Weekend Events</h2>
    <p>
      We know many of you are traveling long distances to share our special day with us, so why not turn it into a special weekend?!
      We'll be renting a house a short distance from downtown Los Gatos and hope that you can join us there for the following events:

    <h3>Friday Night Welcome</h3>
    <p>
      Stop by the house for a glass of wine, s'mores, a gorgeous view of the Santa Cruz mountains and a chance to celebrate our last night as an engaged couple!
    </p>

    <h3>Sunday Farewell Brunch</h3>
    <p>
      Join us for yummy food, mimosas, and one last goodbye before we leave for our honeymoon!
