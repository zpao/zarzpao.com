    <h2 id="h2-hotels-los-gatos">Los Gatos</h2>
    <p>
      We've reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://www.tollhousehotel.com/">Toll House hotel</a>.
      There are a limited number of rooms, so it pays to book sooner rather than later.
    </p>

    <p>
      When booking online, use <strong>GSWD69</strong> in the group code. If it shows there are no rooms available, please call (408.395.7070) to confirm this. The online system sometimes misses rooms (sorry!)
    </p>

    <p>
      If the rooms from the block are all booked up, use your AAA discount! There are also a couple other hotels in Los Gatos that are pretty close to the Toll House
    </p>

    <h2 id="h2-hotels-santa-cruz">Santa Cruz</h2>
    <p>
      We're not setting up any room blocks here, but Santa Cruz is still pretty close to Radonich Ranch.
      We'd rather you stay closeby so that you can easily be a part of the festivities on Friday and Sunday, but if that's what you want to do...
    </p>

    <h2 id="h2-hotels-san-francisco">San Francisco</h2>
    <p>
      We really don't suggest staying in San Francisco.
      You'll be far from the festivities and we wouldn't want you to miss anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're planning on arriving in the bay area early or sticking around after the wedding,
      we'd be happy to suggest places to stay.
