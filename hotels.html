    <h2>Los Gatos</h2>
    <p>
      We're looking into setting up some room blocks at hotels in Los Gatos.
      This is closest to the wedding and we really recommend staying here.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll have a limited number of blocks set up soon. Check back in December for more information.

    <h2>Santa Cruz</h2>
    <p>
      We're not setting up any room blocks here, but Santa Cruz is still pretty close to Radonich Ranch.

    <h2>San Francisco</h2>
    <p>
      We really don't suggest staying in San Francisco.
      You'll be far from the festivities and we wouldn't want you to miss anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're planning on arriving in the bay area early or sticking around after the wedding,
      we'd be happy to suggest places to stay.
